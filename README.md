# NEWMEDIA 's Jenkins Docker Slave image

The Jenkins Continuous Integration and Delivery server. 

This is a fully functional Jenkins server, based on the official jenkins container: https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/ .  The main difference is that this container has the chef client, has the ssh-server daemon package installed and does not have an entry point or a command set.
